        Shri. Genba Sopanrao Moze was a visionary corporator representing the
        Yerwada area of the Pune Corporation, In the days when this area was
        educationally deprived and mostly of the underprivileged class. With his
        astute vision for educating the poor and underprivileged, Genba Moze
        took a keen interest in the welfare and educational uplift of the
        students in this area. He monitored the progress of all the schools in
        this area with zeal and care resulting in a gradual awareness of the
        inevitability of education. Our founder Chairman Rambhau Moze has
        carried forward this torch of enlightening the poor masses with the
        sound weapon of education, by founding the “G.S.MOZE Educational Trust”
        in 1996. This has today blossomed in a gamat of Colleges in various
        disciplines catering to the needs of the needy and underprivileged with
        the aim of providing quality education.
